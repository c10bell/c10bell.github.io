2. #How I clone my repository and waketech class assignments storage
3. I created a repository on Github and cloned it using Github Desktop and website. I created this repository to store class asssignments and work that I may need to collaborate on.
I opened up the GitHub desktoop and I clicked clone repository. I added what I wanted the name to be and then I pushed and fetched the changes on GitHub. After that I was able to access the repository and make changes on GitHub.
